# i3lock-fancy-pixellated-user

To install, clone this into your .config directory. Run `. ~/.config/i3lock-fancy-pixellated-user/lock` to lock the screen, and enter your password to unlock it.

This is based on [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3358vu/i3lock_unixpornworthy_lock_screen/), but with a few changes:
* It shows your username
* It shows your user picture instead of a piccture of a key
* It darkens the screen
